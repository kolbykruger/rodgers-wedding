                    Thank you so much for being a part of our three day wedding extravaganza! We love you all so much
                    and can’t wait to celebrate with you! On this page, you will find all of the information you will
                    need to know about the “weekend”! At the end of the page you will find the itinerary.&nbsp;

                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lodging</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Before the wedding, the venue owner Sharon or assistant Gina will reach out to you to book your stay
                    with us. You will either be placed in a glamping suite or farmhouse suite. Either way, all the
                    lodging will offer a unique experience. Every room is beautiful, breathtaking and just a little bit
                    bougie. Just like us! ;)
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival</span></h3>
                <p>
                    We are asking all of you to arrive at the venue by 12pm on Monday, October 18th. Lunch will be
                    served soon after your arrival, so come hungry!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food/Drinks</span></h3>
                <p>
                    We suggest that you bring a small cooler with some drinks for Monday during the day as we hang about
                    the property and for the bonfire that will be held after the welcome dinner and wedding. (Beer and
                    wine will be served during the welcome dinner and of course a full open bar at the wedding!) We will
                    be providing all meals for all three days! Feel free to bring snacks and drinks for inbetween
                    cravings!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music/Wifi</span></h3>
                <p>
                    The wifi on the property is touch and go so we are asking that if you have any fun playlists on your
                    phone to download them before you come and if you have portable speakers, bring those too! We can’t
                    rely on the internet to play music and we want to make sure we have plenty of music to listen to
                    throughout the weekend!&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goat Yoga</span></h3>
                <p>
                    YES, there will be yoga with goats! On Monday afternoon, there will be an optional goat yoga class
                    that everyone can participate in! We are asking that if you would like to participate to bring
                    between 10-20 dollars in cash to pay for your spot in the class. Don’t forget to bring comfortable
                    yoga/workout attire if you plan on joining us! If you don’t participate, we will think less of you.
                    Just kidding...but seriously.

                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Dinner</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Monday evening we will be hosting a pizza party welcome dinner. Attire is casual. Jeans are great
                    but wear whatever makes you feel good! After dinner, there will be a bonfire at the glamping site to
                    continue the celebrations!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedding Day!</span></h3>
                <p>
                    There will be a bagel and mimosa breakfast served in the farmhouse in the morning! After that, feel
                    free to enjoy the property, relax and get ready! We are asking everyone to be ready at 2:30pm for
                    group photos before the ceremony. Then, let the party begin!
                </p>
